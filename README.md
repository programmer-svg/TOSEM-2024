# Service Implementation

The two implementation for semantic service is located in the directory`implementation/ASTI`  and`implementation/STI` . Please refer to [Implementation](./implementation/README.md)

# Dataset Construct

The code for constructing the dataset is located in the directory `prediction/dataset-construct`. 

Execute the `DatasetConstruct.java` file to construct the dataset.

Other files in this directory:

```
├─grammar : CRL grammar files
├─antlr : files generated by antlr4
├─ASTcompute : Computation of AST-related features
├─code-snippet : Various types of code snippets
├─dataset : Results of dataset construction (datasets used in the paper)
│  ├─RQ3_DEF : Dataset generated with DEF
│  ├─RQ3_LOC : Dataset generated with LOC
│  ├─RQ3_NODE : Dataset generated with NODE
│  └─RQ3_OCC : Dataset generated with OCC
├─fileFeature : Statistic features of generated files
└─serviceRequest : Generate request for corresponding services
```

# Feature Importance

The code for feature Importance is located in the directory `prediction/feature-based`

run `python FeatureImportance.py`  and the results of feature importance are generated in command line.

# Performance Prediction

Before prediction, it is necessary to test the performance of each semantic service. Please refer to  [Implementation](./implementation/README.md)

## Component-based Method

The code for component-based prediction is located in the directory `prediction/component-based`. 

Execute the `ComponentBasedResult.java` file to predict the performance of semantic service. The results are generated in file `Result_componentBased.xlsx`

Other files in this directory:

```
├─performanceResult : Performance testing results of semantic services and components
│  ├─ASTI : Performance under ASTI
│  └─STI : Performance under STI
├─preprocessTime + trainTime + predictTime.xlsx :  the Computational Time Cost
└─process : Process the results and make predictions
```

## Feature-based Method

The code for feature-based prediction is located in the directory `prediction/feature-based`

run `python prediction.py` and the results are generated in file `prediction.xlsx`. 

Other files in this directory:

```
├─data : Performance testing results of semantic services and components
│  ├─symbolTable : Performance under ASTI
│  └─semanticTree : Performance under STI
└─FeatureImportance.py : compute the feature importance
```
